# Mike Medrano Portfolio (Updated 08/03/21)

## Employer-Ready and Employer-Competitive
- As a Full Stack Developer (9 weeks in progress), I want to showcase my work to employers by providing them samples to be reviewed and assess whether I am potential candidate for any and all opportunities whether full-time or part-time.


## Portfolio Targets:
- When my portfolio is viewed:
    - The employer knows my name, is provided a photo, along with links to sections about me.
    - They can click on the links on the navigation which will take them to the corresponding section. 
    - They can click on the link to the section about my work which takes them to a section with titled images of my applications.
    -  They can view my work where images are provided as well as live site URl and Repository. 
    - The site remains responsive for desktop and mobile.
