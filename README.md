# Mike Medrano Portfolio

## Employer-Ready and Employer-Competitive
- As a Full Stack Developer (in progress), I want to showcase my work to employers by providing them samples to be reviewed and assess whether I am good candidate for any and all  open position whether full-time or part-time.


## Portfolio Targets:
- When my portfolio is viewed:
    - The employer knows my name, is provided a photo, along with links to sections about me.
    - They can click on the links on the navigation which will take them to the corresponding section. 
    - They can click on the link to the section about my work which takes them to a section with titled images of my applications.
    -  They can click on my work the first application image is larger in size than the others. 
    - They can click on images of the Application which takes them to the deployed application.
    - They can resize the page to view the site on various screens and devices that provide a responsive layout that adapts to their viewpoint.
